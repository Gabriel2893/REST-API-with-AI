# Creation of a REST API project with AI

## üìö About the Project

In this repository, you will find the source code of a REST API, built with Java 21 and Spring Boot 3, (developed during the Santander Dev Week 2024)

> [!NOTE]
> Objective: "Allow users to converse with League of Legends (LOL) champions".

To achieve this, i used some of the latest Generative Artificial Intelligences (AIs), enabling our API to "understand" the unique personality of each champion to create interactions that capture their essence, making each conversation a unique experience.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Architectural Diagram
Next, I'll show you the project's architectural diagram (written with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)), highlighting the separation of responsibilities between the layers. From the user interface to the mechanisms for interacting with external systems, including adapters, use cases and the central entities of the domain, each element is strategically positioned to reinforce the modularity, scalability and maintainability of the system. This structure makes it easier to understand how the components collaborate to achieve the software's objectives, in line with the principles of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) (including the colors of the elements).

### Directory Structure

Reflecting the organization shown in the architectural diagram, the project's directory structure suggests a simplified Clean Architecture, aiming for a clear separation of responsibilities and promoting the autonomy of the layers in a Spring Boot project. This structural approach not only facilitates code maintenance and evolution, but also supports integration and effective collaboration between the different parts of the application. Below, we detail the layout of the directories that make up the application, each playing a specific role within the software ecosystem:

-   `adapters/`: It includes the adapters that facilitate communication between the application and the outside world (the only directory that ‚Äúknows‚Äù Spring).
    -   `in/`: It houses the input adapters, such as REST controllers, which handle user requests.
    -   `out/`: It contains the outbound adapters, responsible for interacting with databases and external APIs, for example.
-   `application/`: It hosts the application's use cases, encapsulating the essential business logic.
-   `domain/`: It represents the heart of the application, comprising entities, exceptions and interfaces (ports) that articulate the fundamental business rules.
    -   `exception/`: Defines the custom exceptions relevant to the domain.
    -   `model/`: It models the entities of the domain, reflecting the core concepts of the application.
    -   `ports/`: It establishes the interfaces that outline the contracts for adapters and external services.
-   `Application.java`: The main class that orchestrates the configuration and execution of the application.

### SQL Database in Memory

The use of the H2 database in this project serves as an agile and flexible foundation for modeling our knowledge domain - the LOL champions. This choice allows for rapid prototyping and an efficient development environment, which is essential for storing and retrieving detailed information about each champion. In this way, we ensure that the Generative AIs we integrate can access a rich and detailed repository, allowing them to accurately capture the essence and unique personality of each champion, thus enriching the interactivity and depth of the interactions carried out.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS champions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    lore TEXT,
    image_url VARCHAR(255)
);
